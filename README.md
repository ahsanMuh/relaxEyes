# relaxEyes

A simple script to remind you to take break from staring at your computer. When it's time to take a break your screen will dim it's brightness. Break timings are based on 20-20-20 rule.

### 20-20-20 rule

Your eye doctor may mentioned about it. It's basically for every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds.
